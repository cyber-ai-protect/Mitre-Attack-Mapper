# Mitre-Attack-Mapper

This tool lets you parse the whole Mitre Attack in search of all TTPs matching a specific keyword.
For instance, let's say you want to have a heatmap with all ransomware related TTPs, boom you have it within seconds.

No need to manually select which Threat Actor or Campaign or Software, the tool does it for you!
The script then ensures to not have any duplicates, and build a JSON heatmap that Mitre Attack Navigator understands.

And then you can focus on other tasks.
